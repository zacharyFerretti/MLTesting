Repository where I am toying with deep learning code.

## Project Goal

As of late, I have been working a lot on graphic design. This has been a lot of fun as I have been able to get into another medium of art, which I had not done in quite a while. Any graphic designer will tell you that one of if not _the_ most important part of any graphic design is coming up with your color palette. 

Throughout my years of photography, I like to think that I have developed a distinct style that is truly my own. So I had an idea to leverage what I have been working on with AI/ML in order to use my photographs as a model to learn how to generate color palettes. The end goal will for me to be able to enter in a color in a Pythonic interface and then a number of other colros I want generated, and the script to generate a palette of colors that work well with the input color.

### _Reach Goal_
If I were able to figure out how to host this model and script on an AWS service and save it between runs that would be incredibly useful, as it would allow other people to access the functionality of this script as well as send it online to people in order to get more information of what are or are not colors that work together.

## Current Working Objectives
_Note: for the remainder of this document if I use the word complimentary, I am using it to mean two colors look good together. Not the color theory definition of complimentary_
* ~~Generate a script that allows me to recursively perform k-means clustering on entire folders and save that output to a CSV file~~This was completed in another different repository I plan on adding this script into this repo, but have not yet. For now you can find that repository [here.](https://gitlab.com/zacharyFerretti/python-dominant-color)

* ~~Write a program that allows me to manually label color pairs as complimentary or as clashing.~~ __Completed January 19th__

* ~~Make a neural network that can predict whether or not colors are complimentary~~ __Completed January 20th__

* I want to continue working to make the model more effective and then begin generating colors and predicting their complimentary 'ness' with the input color.

##The Story So Far

To start this project, I had to update my
