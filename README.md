# deep-education
Repository where I am toying with deep learning code.

## Project Goal

As of late, I have been working a lot on graphic design. This has been a lot of fun as I have been able to get into another medium of art, which I had not done in quite a while. Any graphic designer will tell you that one of if not _the_ most important part of any graphic design is coming up with your color palette. 

Throughout my years of photography, I like to think that I have developed a distinct style that is truly my own. So I had an idea to leverage what I have been working on with AI/ML in order to use my photographs as a model to learn how to generate color palettes. The end goal will for me to be able to enter in a color in a Pythonic interface and then a number of other colros I want generated, and the script to generate a palette of colors that work well with the input color.

### _Reach Goal_
If I were able to figure out how to host this model and script on an AWS service and save it between runs that would be incredibly useful, as it would allow other people to access the functionality of this script as well as send it online to people in order to get more information of what are or are not colors that work together.

## Current Working Objectives
* ~~Generate a script that allows me to recursively perform k-means clustering on entire folders and save that output to a CSV file[^1]~~ 

[^1]: This was completed in another different repository I plan on adding this script into this repo, but have not yet. For now you can find that repository [here.](https://gitlab.com/zacharyFerretti/python-dominant-color)
